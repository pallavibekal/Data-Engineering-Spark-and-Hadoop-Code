        "NoSQL ('Not only SQL') is a non-relational or distributed database system. It has a dynamic schema, best suited for hierarchical data storage. It is horizontally scalable.\n",

        "Whereas **SQL databases** are used for querying and manipulating structured query language (SQL) and are very powerful and versatile, they also have the disadvantage of being restrictive: SQL requires the usage of predefined schemas to determine the structure of the data before you work with it; Also all of your data must follow the same structure. This can require significant prior preparation, which offers challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **NoSQL database** has dynamic schema for unstructured data. It stores data in many ways, such as document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue. This flexibility means that documents can be created without having a prior defined structure. Also, each document can have its own unique structure. The syntax varies from database to database, and you can add fields as you go.\n",

        "- **Structure**: SQL databases are table-based. NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases, or wide-column stores. Relational SQL databases are a better option for applications that require multi-row transactions such as an accounting system.\n",
        "- **Property**: SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL databases follow the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance). \n",

A NoSQL database may provide a data model that better fits the application’s needs, thus simplifying that interaction and resulting in less code to write, debug, and evolve.\n",
        "* Large-scale data: Organizations are finding it valuable to capture more data and process it more quickly. They are finding it expensive, if even possible, to do so with relational databases. The primary reason is that a relational database is designed to run on a single machine, but it is usually more economic to run large data and computing loads on clusters of many smaller and cheaper machines. Many NoSQL databases are designed explicitly to run on clusters, so they make a better fit for big data scenarios.\n",
